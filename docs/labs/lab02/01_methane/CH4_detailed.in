 # This is a pretty minimal pw.x input file that makes extensive use of the
 # values in the three sections 'control', 'system' and 'electrons'. Typically
 # you'll want to specify many more things than we have here.

 # The help file with details of all the parameters and their values is at
 # /opt/share/quantum-espresso/doc-6.1/INPUT_PW.txt

 # While we accept all defaults in the CONTROL and ELECTRONS sections, all
 # the sections used here must always be present (there are a number of
 # additional sections which may also be needed depending on the values used
 # the CONTROL and SYSTEM sections.

 &CONTROL
    ! This section is used to control the calculation we want to do, such as
    ! change the calculation type, the level of output, the directory where
    ! output is stored, etc.
    !
    ! We can accept most defaults to start with.
    !
    ! For example the default type of calculation is 'scf' which is what we
    ! want.
    ! The only thing we'll set is the parameter that says it should look in
    ! the same directory where you run the code for the pseudopotential file.
    pseudo_dir = '.'
 /

 &SYSTEM
    ! There are a number of required input variables in the "system" section.

    ! This is the index of the type of Bravais-lattice we have. 1 is for simple cubic.
    ! This tells the code what parameters need to be specified for the lattice.
    ibrav = 1

    ! This is the lattice length, which is the only free parameter for simple cubic.
    ! A is in Angstrom. For molecules we take this to be large enough that the
    ! molecule doesn't interact too strongly with its periodic replicas.
    A = 15.0

    ! This is the number of atoms in the cell.
    nat = 5

    ! This is the number of types of atoms. We have carbon and hydrogen so this is 2.
    ntyp = 2

    ! This is the planewave energy cutoff in Rydberg - more on this next week.
    ecutwfc = 18.0
 /

 &ELECTRONS
    ! This section is used to set how the electronic calculations converge for
    ! self-consistent calculations.
    !
    ! Again we can accept all defaults.
    !
    ! Here we could, for example, set a lower convergence threshold for when
    ! the code decides the self-consistent calculation is converged. Or
    ! increase the maximum number of iterations.

# In this section we list all the atomic species, so we need to have as many
# entries as 'ntyp' above. These should be entered one per line, with the
# atomic symbol, followed by the mass (only used for certain types of
# calculations), followed by the name of the pseudopotential. In the same
# directory as the input file we have a symbolic link to the pseudotential
# file we need. This saves us from making multiple copies of the same file
# for different calculations.
ATOMIC_SPECIES
 C  12.011  C.pz-vbc.UPF
 H   1.008  H.pz-vbc.UPF

# Now we list the postitions of all the atoms. There are several possible ways
# to do this. Here we give the positions in cartesian coordinates, in Angstrom.
# There should be one line for each atom in the cell - so 'nat' lines in total.
ATOMIC_POSITIONS angstrom
 C  0.0       0.0       0.0
 H  0.0       0.0       1.089
 H  1.026719  0.000000 -0.363000
 H -0.513360 -0.889165 -0.363000
 H -0.513360  0.889165 -0.363000

# Finally we specify the k-point sampling to use. For molecules we just use the
# gamma point - more on this later in the course.
