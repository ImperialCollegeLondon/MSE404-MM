To do this, we will employ the \\(\\Delta\\)SCF method, i.e. we will perform SCF calculations for the neutral molecule (with \\(N\\) electrons) and the charged molecule (\\(N\\pm 1\\) electrons) at the geometry of the neutral molecule and compute the difference in the total energies (\\(E_{N} \\pm E_{N+1}\\)). In doing so, we are neglecting the effect of geometry relaxation in the charged system, and therfore the difference in nuclear-nuclear repulsion energies, that would be different in two different geometries. However, photoemission is a fast process and therefore the neglect of relaxations in the charged state is often justified when comparing to  experiments.</p> <p>Due to the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction, electrostatic sums on an infinite lattice, or equivalently,  in a system subject to periodic boundary conditions (PBC), are not always absolutely convergent and in fact  the sum is divergent if the system is charged, which makes the above-mentioned energy differences ill-defined.  When using PBC, one can simulate an isolated molecule using a supercell with enough vacuum space. However, the energy calculated for a finite  supercell differs from that of an infinite supercell, because of the spurious interactions  of the charged system and its periodic images (as we have seen already this is also true for  neutral system with no permanent dipole, but in this case the electrostatic sum is absolutely  convergent and one can get away with a relatively small supercell size).</p> <p>In DFT code with PBC, charged systems are usually addressed by introducing a compensating  uniform jellium background, such that the total charge of the supercell is zero. This is of course an approximation  and it's only justified in the \\(L\\rightarrow\\infty\\) limit, where \\(L\\) is the linear dimension  of the supercell. Hence, one way to study charged systems within DFT is to compute the total  energy for increasing values of the supercell size and extrapolating from these the  value at \\(L\\rightarrow\\infty\\). </p> <p>More refined methods have been developed to treat charged systems within PBC and small supercells, such as the Makov-Payne method and Martyna-Tuckerman method,  which we will also use in this lab. The Makov-Payne method applies a cell size-dependent correction to the total energy based on an asymptotic analysis of the total energy of charged system with respect to the supercell size. This allows to get a faster convergence with respect to the supercell size. The Martyna-Tuckerman method, on the other hand, introduces a cut-off in real space beyond which interactions are set to zero. As a rule of thumb, the supercell  should be more than twice as large as the size of the molecule for this to be a good approximation.</p> <p>In Quantum ESPRESSO you can enable the calculation of charged systems by setting <code>tot_charge = +1</code>, if one electron is removed, or <code>tot_charge = -1</code>, if one electron is added, and so on, in the <code>SYSTEM</code> section of the input file. When having an odd number of electrons (e.g. an unpaired electron) we also need to perform a spin-polarised calculation, since we now have a different number of electrons in the two spin-channels. This can be done by setting <code>nspin=2</code>. Finally, we need to specify the occupation of the Kohn-Sham states. In molecules, with non-dengerate HOMO-LUMO, we want that each KS state is either fully occupied or empty. This can be achieved by setting <code>occupations=fixed</code>.</p> <p>The molecular orbitals diagram for the CO molecule can be found at this website </p>"},{"location":"labs/extras/labs/charged_system/readme/#task","title":"Task","text":"<p>Compute the ionization energy of carbon monoxide.

This can be related to local and semilocal XC functionals being unable to remove spurious self-interactions arising from the Hartree term. For instance, if  we consider a simple one-electron system like the hydrogen atom, one can easily see that the Hartree energy \\(E_{H}[n] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\frac{n(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r}')}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'}|} d^3r d^3r'\\) implies an unphysical self-interaction of the electron with itself. This contribution should be compensated by the XC term, but an exact cancellation is not possible with local and semilocal functionals. This means that a percentage of this spurious contribution remains and pushes up the energies of the occupied states. At the same time, unoccupied states do not contribute to the total density and therefore no self-interaction term arises from them. As a net result, the gap between occupied and unoccupied states is reduced.</p> <p>To ameliorate this problem several so-called hybrid XC functionals have been proposed. These are non-local XC functionals based on the electron density and Kohn-Sham orbitals as well, i.e. \\(E_{XC}^{hyb} [n(\\mathbf{r}),{\\phi_{KS}(\\mathbf{r})}]\\). The main idea, is to add to the (semi)local XC functionals a percentage of the exact exchange term, which is a functional of the KS orbitals. In fact, from Hartree-Fock  theory it is well known that there is a perfect cancellation between the Hartree and the Exchange terms for the self-interaction.</p> <p>In this part we are going to compute the band structure of titanium dioxide (rutile phase) with a semilocal XC functional (PBE) and  we will see how using the <code>B3LYP</code> hybrid XC functional improves the band gap compared to the experimental value. You are not going to explicitely run a DFT calculation with a hybrid functional as this is quite computationally demanding, particularly with a plane-wave basis set (can you think of why?)</p> <p>The B3LYP energy functional is a very popular hybrid functional and it is obtained by: \\(E_{XC}^{B3LYP} = (1-a)E_{X}^{LSDA} + a E_{X}^{HF} + b \\Delta E_{X}^{B88} + (1-c)E_{C}^{LSDA} + c E_{C}^{LYP}\\), where the subscrpits \\(X\\) and \\(C\\) mean exchange and correlation, respectively. The superscripts, on the other hand, identify the different functional forms, for instance \\(HF\\) means Hartree-Fock, \\(LSDA\\) means local spin-density approximation, \\(B88\\) Becke88 functional and \\(LYP\\) the Lee-Young-Parr functional. The three parameters in B3LYP have the following values \\(a=0.2\\), \\(b=0.72\\) and \\(c=0.81\\). Finally \\(\\Delta E\\) means a gradient correction to the functional. You can see that in B3LYP one introduces a fraction (0.2) of the Hartree-Fock exchange, which is a non-local functional.</p> <p>The rutile phase of TiO2 is a direct wide-gap semiconductor, with an experimental bandgap of \\(3.3\\) eV.

In the molecule we have two hydrogen atoms bonded together, and two electrons in total, and we can do this with a standard calculation.</p> <p>But if we instead want to find the energy of an isolated H atom accurately it's a little more tricky. A hydrogen atom has one electron, which means if we treat it with doubly-degenerate bands, we would have a single half occupied band. To calculate it like this we can treat it as a metal, and use some small smearing, so that we allow partial occupation of bands. This is equivalent to assuming that we have half an electron in each spin state. If we however restrict it to being in one spin state or another, we may find a slightly different energy (coming primarily from differences in how the DFT exchange term is calculated in each case, with the latter being more physical).</p> <p>The directory <code>01_H1_metal</code> has an input file for a single H atom using a small smearing, while the directory <code>01_H1_spin</code> has the same calculation, but with no smearing, and we have used the input variables <code>nspin</code> and <code>tot_magnetization</code> to enable a spin polarized calculation.</p> <ul> <li>Run the input files in these two folders.</li> <li>Compare the total energy obtained in each case.

How close   are you here?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"labs/extras/labs/tddft/readme/","title":"Additional Material: Optical Properties and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory","text":"<p>Among the most useful class of properties to be able to predict for a molecule or crystal are its optical properties. These can be used to find the frequencies of optical radiation that will be absorbed or emitted, based on its electronic structure. This can be used to find, for example, what colour a dye molecule will have in a solvent.</p> <p>There are several ways these properties could be calculated starting from density functional theory. The method we'll look at in this lab is time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). A TDDFT code could be used to calculate the evolution of the electrons under the effect of the oscillating electric field associated with the presence of a photon. This would be a fairly intensive calculation, and would need to be repeated at many different energies to build up the full optical spectrum.</p> <p>The set of codes that comes with the quantum espresso package, turboTDDFT, actually use time-dependent density functional perturbation theory (TDDFPT) to calculate optical spectra of molecules. This calculates the response of the system to the oscillating electric field associated with an incoming photon using perturbation theory (polarizability), in a similar way to how DFPT finds the response of the system to perturbations of the atomic positions. It then uses this to find the susceptibility as a function of photon energy. The code also uses an approach known as the Liouville-Lanczos method which allows it to calculate the full optical spectrum for a wide energy range, at a very moderate cost.</p> <p>Typically if you want to understand what energy of photon will be absorbed, you might expect you would need to know the difference between the energy of the occupied and empty states: when a photon is absorbed it excites an electron from an occupied state to an empty state higher in energy by an amount equal to the photon energy. The turboTDDFT codes use a clever approach to avoid the need for including a large number of additional empty states in the calculation. This involves instead using the projection operator on to the occupied states. Details of this are given in a paper outlining the methods used in the turboTDDFT code. This is distributed with the quantum espresso package. You can find it on the mt-student server in <code>/opt/share/quantum-espresso/doc-6.3/turboTDDFT-CPC.pdf</code>. There are also slides on the quantum espresso website outlining the approach and making a comparison to the more basic TDDFT method at https://www.quantum-espresso.org/resources/tutorials/shanghai-2013/TDDFT_Talk_Gebauer.handouts.pdf</p> <p>Despite the various advantages offered by the approaches used in this code, this will still be the most intensive calculation you'll have done so far. However it is much faster than would be the case if we needed to manually look at many photon energies and including many empty states in our DFT calculation.</p> <p>You should also keep in mind that this approach is for fixed nuclear positions and does not include the effect of interatomic vibrations which may also couple to an incoming photon, either directly if the energy range is similar, or indirectly if, for example, a photon creates an excited electron and vibration simultaneously. Generally by looking in a particular energy range, the dominant effects will be from one mechanism or another. For example, the homo-lumo gap in methane is around 10 eV in LDA-DFT, while the highest energy atomic vibrations are around 0.4 eV. This means that if we're looking at the effect of photons in the 10-50 eV range (vacuum UV to extreme UV), the effect of the atomic vibrations will be minor. But we don't immediately have the spectrum across all energy ranges.</p> <p>As with some of the other more advanced calculations we looked at, we'll be doing this calculation in several stages:</p> <ol> <li>A self consistent calculation of the molecule is performed. We can do this    in the same way as previously. No special inputs are needed.</li> <li>We'll use the <code>turbo_lanczos.x</code> code which does the TDDFPT calculation    using the aforementioned Liouville-Lanczos method. This is the first, and    more computationally intensive step in calculating the polarizability. It    calculates the components of a tridiagonal matrix that will be used in a    subsequent code, for each optical polarization direction.</li> <li>We'll use the <code>turbo_spectrum.x</code> code to take the tridiagonal matrix    generated in the previous step, generate the polarizability and from it    find both the susceptibility tensor and the oscillator strength as a    function of photon energy.<ul> <li>The susceptibility tensor relates the electric field to the induced    electric polarization</li> <li>the oscillator strength gives the probability of absorption or emission    of photons.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"labs/extras/labs/tddft/readme/#optical-spectrum-of-methane","title":"Optical Spectrum of Methane","text":"<p>The directory <code>CH4</code> contains a set of example inputs to perform this calculation for a methane molecule.</p> <ul> <li>Start by examining the <code>pw.x</code> input file   <code>01_CH4_scf.in</code>.

This is fairly short. As usual, we have   accepted the default values for most of the input parameters. You can see   the full list of inputs in the <code>INPUT_LANCZOS.txt</code> file in the quantum   espresso documentation directory. We have specified two sections in the   input file:<ul> <li><code>LR_INPUT</code> where we set the <code>prefix</code> and <code>outdir</code> to match the scf   calculation, and</li> <li><code>LR_CONTROL</code> where we set<ul> <li><code>itermax = 400</code> which tells it how many elements of the Lanczos   chain to calculate (elements of the tridiagonal matrix). While in   principle more elements will give us a more accurate result, the   subsequent code can extrapolate these to a very high number. Usually   on the order of 500 to 1000 is sufficient to calculate explicitly,   though we'll look at how this converges later.

To do this we can use the <code>projwfc.x</code> tool from the Quantum Espresso package. This is used in a similar way to the <code>dos.x</code> tool, although it is not possible to use tetrahedra to integrate the DOS, so a broadening must be used.</p> <p>A set of example input files for diamond are given in the directory <code>03_projecteddos/01_diamond</code>. This set of inputs follows exactly the same progression as previously, except now for the third step we have an input file for <code>projwfc.x</code> rather than for <code>dos.x</code>. In this file we have a single <code>PROJWFC</code> section, but we have actually retained the same inputs we used previously in the DOS calculation. As usual, you can get full details of the various inputs that are available in the help file <code>INPUT_PROJWFC.txt</code>.</p> <p>Now run these three calculations as before. Again a short script has been provided which does this explicitly. Once they have completed you'll see we again have generated a <code>pwscf.dos</code> file as before. You can try to plot this if you like, and you'll see it's identical to the density of states we obtained with the equivalent <code>dos.x</code> calculation. However, we also have a number of other files that have been generated, all with names beginning with <code>pwscf.pdos_</code> by default. Try looking at <code>pwscf.pdos_tot</code> first. You'll see this is a three column file, with energy, density of states, and the total of the various decomposed projected density of states. In principle column 2 and 3 should be the same (and column 2 will reproduce the already calculated density of states), but in practice it can be difficult to assign conduction band states accurately so there may be some small disagreement there.</p> <p>The additional files will the projected density of states for each atom in the unit cell and each orbital type (s, p, d etc) present. If you look, for example at the file <code>pwscf.pdos_atm#1(C)_wfc#1(s)</code>, you'll see we have three columns: energy, a column labelled <code>ldos</code> and a column labelled <code>pdos</code>. For s-orbitals we only have one value of the magnetic quantum number ml, so there is only one pdos column, and the ldos and pdos columns are equivalent. If you look at the file <code>pwscf.pdos_atm#1(C)_wfc#2(p)</code> you'll see we now have 5 columns: energy, ldos, and 3 pdos columns. ldos gives the sum of the three pdos columns, and each pdos column is for a different value of ml (3 for a p-orbital).</p> <p>In our case, the corresponding files for each of the C atoms in the cell should be equivalent as the two atoms in the cell are equivalent. For one of the atoms, try plotting the projected density of states of the s-orbital and one of the p-orbitals (e.g. try plotting the 3rd column in each file) together.

As an example, we will investigate three different isomers of  C\\(_{20}\\):</p> <ul> <li>C\\(_{20}\\) in a bowl structure</li> </ul> <ul> <li>C\\(_{20}\\) in a ring structure</li> </ul> <ul> <li>C\\(_{20}\\) in a cage structure.</li> </ul> <p>If you are wondering if this is a calculation people really do, here is an article doing this exact calculation</p> <p>Task 8 - Total Energy of Isomers</p> <ul> <li> <p>Run the inputs for the three different isomers in <code>04_c20_bowl</code>, <code>05_c20_ring</code> and <code>06_c20_cage</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Which isomer has the lowest total energy?</p> </li> </ul> Answer <p>\\(E_{\\text{Tot}}^{\\text{Bowl}} = -218.12237988 \\,\\text{Ry}\\)</p> <p>\\(E_{\\text{Tot}}^{\\text{Ring}} = -217.76506479 \\,\\text{Ry}\\)</p> <p>\\(E_{\\text{Tot}}^{\\text{Cage}} = -218.37740806 \\,\\text{Ry}\\)</p> <p>Using \\(E_{\\text{Tot}}^{\\text{Cage}}\\) as a reference, we can calculate the energy differences between the structures. Doing so we can see that the the cage structure has the lowest energy.</p> <ul> <li>What does it mean to have the lowest total energy of the three isomers? What conclusions about stability can we draw from these calculations?</li> </ul> Answer <p>The lowest energy typically means that the structure is the most stable. However, these energies are very close, so it is hard to draw conclusions based on these calculations. Additionally, one can compare the energy differences between the structures to \\(k_BT\\) at room temperature, \\(25\\) meV. If the energy difference between the structures is within \\(25\\) meV of one another, then the structures are degenerate and no conclusions about stability can be drawn.</p> <p>You will notice that the three isomers are very close in total energy. Maybe we can find some other isomers with even lower energies. For example, we can try an amorphous structure.</p> <p>Or a \"smiley\" face :-).</p> <p>Task 9 - Amorphous and Unrealistic Calculation</p> <ul> <li>Run the inputs for the amorphous structure found in <code>07_c20_amorphous</code>. How does the energy compare to the three isomers above? Is this what you expect?</li> </ul> Answer <p>\\(E_{\\text{Tot}}^{\\text{Amorphous}} = -217.09834389 \\,\\text{Ry}\\)</p> <p>Again, comparing this to \\(E_{\\text{Tot}}^{\\text{Cage}}\\) we can see that this has the highest energy of the three isomers. This is expected as amorphous structures are typically higher in energy due to their disorder.</p> <p>Finally we can run a calculation for the smiley face.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Navigate to <code>08_c20_smile</code> and visualise the structure. </p> </li> <li> <p>Run a DFT calculation and compare the total energies to your previous results for the other isomers. Is this what we expect?</p> </li> </ul> Answer <p>\\(E_{\\text{Tot}}^{\\text{Smile}} = -216.92843483 \\,\\text{Ry}\\)</p> <p>This is even higher than that of the amorphous structure. This is expected as this is a totally unrealistic structure and we do not expect it to be stable.</p> <p>In the paper linked above it was shown that the relative energies of the ring, cage and bowl structure are very sensitive to the details of the approach used. For these systems using just DFT it is hard to say with certainty which is the most stable isomer. However, comparing to less realistic structures we can see the difference in energy between structures which should be stable and which should not be stable, which is very valuable information.</p> <p>Convergence Issues</p> <p>If you were to use a structure which more closely resembled a smiley face, Quantum Espresso would be unable to reach convergence within 100 iterations, just as when we used the wrong units for ethene.  If you encounter a problem with convergence, the first thing you should check is whether or not the input structure is sensible which underlines the importance of visualising your structures before you run calculations!</p>"},{"location":"labs/lab02/readme/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>In this lab we have looked at how to create input files and examine the output files for some different molecules:</p> <ul> <li>Methane</li> <li>Ethane</li> <li>Ethene</li> <li>Different isomers of C\\(_{20}\\)</li> </ul> <p>We have also learned how to use VESTA to visualise our structures with the help of the <code>c2x</code>.</p>"},{"location":"labs/lab03/readme/","title":"Convergence Tests","text":"<p>This week we are going to continue on the topic of DFT calculations for isolated molecules.

In the region between the atomic nuclei where chemical bonding takes place, the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions are relatively smooth and therefore not too many plane wave are needed to accurately describe them. However, very close to the atomic nucleus the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions vary rapidly (this is a consequence of the requirement that the valence orbital are orthogonal to the tightly bound core orbitals) and lots of plane waves are needed corresponding to a high plane-wave cutoff. Unfortunately, this would make the calculations very slow...</p> <p>To get around this problem, Quantum Espresso uses pseudopotentials. The idea is to combine the atomic nucleus with the tightly bound core electrons (which do not participate in chemical bonding) into an atomic core whose interaction with the valence electrons is described by the pseudopotential. Since there are no more core electrons in the calculations, the valence electrons do not exhibit rapid variations near the nucleus any more and a low plane-wave cutoff can be used. </p> <p>In the figure below, you can see the true \"all-electron\" potential and the resulting \"all-electron\" wavefunctions (blue-dashed lines) and also the pseudopotential and the corresponding pseudo-wavefunctions (red lines): </p> <p>Note that the pseudopotentials are generated from DFT calculations of isolated atoms.

For example, molecules containing elements that have d orbitals require much higher kinetic energy cutoffs.

In contrast to a molecule, where the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions of all states are fully contained in the unit cell of our DFT calculation, the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions of electrons in crystals are delocalized over many unit cells. In other words: each unit cell only contains a small fraction of the electron which occupies a certain Bloch Kohn-Sham state.

See the tip box below for how to calculate the new lattice constant.   </li> </ol> </li> </ul> Tip on calculating the new lattice constant <p>The most general way to do this is to calculate the magnitude of each lattice vector. For example, the lattice constant along \\(\\mathbf{a}_1\\) is \\(\\frac{a_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\times\\sqrt{a_{1x}^2+a_{1y}^2+a_{1z}^2}\\). Here \\(a_{1x}=-0.534\\), \\(a_{1y}=0\\), \\(a_{1z}=0.534\\), and \\(a_0=6.236\\) Bohrs. Using this method for the remaining two lattice vectors, you should find that the lattice constants are the same along the three directions.  </p> <p>However, for <code>ibrav=2</code>, there is a simpler way. You can simply calculate the ratio of the new and old Cartesian components of the lattice vectors, and multiply that by the original lattice constant. For example, \\(a_{1x}^{\\mathrm{new}}/a_{1x}^{\\mathrm{old}}\\times a_0\\), here \\(a_{1x}^{\\mathrm{old}}=-0.5\\). </p> <ul> <li>What is the final lattice constant? </li> </ul> Answer <p>Using any of the methods from the tip box, the new lattice constant is 6.66 Bohrs, which is 3.53 \u00c5. This is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 3.57 \u00c5 (from Wikipedia).  </p> <ul> <li>How can you check if the lattice parameter is fully relaxed? </li> </ul> Answer <p>The pressure is 0.32 kbar, which is very small.  </p> <p>A word on the final pressure in the output file</p> <p>The final pressure at the end of the optimisation might appear large occasionally. This is because Quantum Espresso uses the basis set for the original input unit cell to calculate the pressure of the relaxed unit cell. However, if your cell has changed drastically, the adequate basis set for the relaxed unit cell should be recalculated based on the new lattice constant. So you should run a new scf calculation in that case. The artificial pressure due to the inadequacy of the plane-wave basis size is called the Pulay stress. You can look it up if interested.</p>"},{"location":"labs/lab07/readme/#bulk-modulus-of-crystals","title":"Bulk modulus of crystals","text":"<p>From the PES, we can calculate the bulk modulus, B, which measures how difficult it is to compress the material.

You can increase the PW cutoff to reduce them, but the <code>ph.x</code> calculation will take longer.  </p> What are the degeneracies of each distinct frequency? <p>In the order of increasing energy, the degeneracies (i.e. the number of normal modes with the same frequency) are 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3. One finds such degeneracies in molecules that have a symmetrical shape. </p> <p>Visualising the normal modes</p> <p>If you are interested in how the normal modes look like, you can visit this link.

You will see symbols like \\(T_2\\) and \\(A_1\\) next to each mode. These symbols are intended for vibrational spectroscopists to identify the normal modes.  Notice how the degenerate normal modes have the same symbols and very similar vibration patterns.</p> Extra notes - why do the three lowest normal modes always have zero frequency? <p>These normal modes correspond to the rigid translations of the molecule, i.e. movements of the molecule without distorting any chemical bonds. If no bonds are distorted, the molecule will not vibrate and the vibrational frequency should be zero. You can inspect the polarization vectors of these normal modes: there are the same for all atoms. In fact, the three modes are simply rigid translations along the \\(y\\), \\(x\\), and \\(z\\)-directions, respectively.   </p> Extra notes - symmetry reduction in Quantum Espresso <p>Quantum Espresso can exploit the symmetries of the molecule to reduce the number of the (rather costly) DFPT calculations: by placing the center of the molecule at the origin and giving the H atoms the same \\(x,y\\) coordinates except for the sign, the code understands that the methane molecule has certain rotational symmetries.
